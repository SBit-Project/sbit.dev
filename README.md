# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Contributing

There are a couple of ways in which you can contribute to the website, for example:

- [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/sbit-project/sbit.dev/issues), and help us verify as they are checked in.
- Review the [website](https://sbit-project.github.io/sbit.dev/) and make pull requests for anything from typos to new content suggestion.
