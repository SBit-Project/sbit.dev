In this chapter we will deploy an SRC20 token on SBIT. All SRC20 compliant token contracts support a common set of methods:

```
contract SRC20 {
    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint totalSupply);
    function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining);
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value); }
}
```

Because all tokens share the same interface, it is much easier for wallets and exchanges to support all the different tokens out there in the wild.

In what follows, we will deploy the
[CappedToken](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/4ce0e211c500aa756120c4f2851cc75518123309/contracts/token/CappedToken.sol), implemented by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin). We won't need to modify the contract in any way to make it work on SBIT.

The `CappedToken` is an SRC20 compliant token, inheriting the basic functionalities from both [StandardToken](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/4ce0e211c500aa756120c4f2851cc75518123309/contracts/token/StandardToken.sol) and [MintableToken](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/MintableToken.sol).

In particular,

- `StandardToken` implements the SRC20 interface.
- `MintableToken` adds the `mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)` method, to create new tokens out of thin air.
- `CappedToken` adds limit to the max supply of tokens that could be minted.

## Deploy CappedToken

Create the project directory, and clone the [zeppelin-solidity](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity) repository to the project directory:

```shell
mkdir mytoken && cd mytoken

git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity.git --branch v1.5.0
```

For this exercise, we'll start `sbitd` from scratch, in regtest mode:

```shell
docker run -it --rm \
  --name myapp \
  -v `pwd`:/dapp \
  -p 9899:9899 \
  -p 9888:9888 \
  sbitproject/sbitportal
```

Enter into the container:

```shell
docker exec -it myapp sh
```

Generate some initial balance:

```shell
scli generate 600
```

## The Owner Address

The SRC20 token we deploy will be "owned" by a particular UTXO address. A few administrative methods are protected, such that only the owner of the contract may use them.

These methods are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which checks whether the `msg.sender` is the contract's `owner`:

```
modifier onlyOwner() {
  require(msg.sender == owner);
  _;
}
```

For example, the method `mint` makes sure that only the owner can use it:

```
function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyOwner canMint public returns (bool)
```

## Create The Owner Address And Fund It

Let's generate an address to act as the owner.

```shell
scli getnewaddress
sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj
```

There's nothing special about this address. You could use the address of any UTXO in your wallet.

Let's fund the owner address with 10 SBIT, to pay for gas when we deploy our contract later:

```shell
scli sendtoaddress sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj 10

cf652f54e6a6dde3e60fa4e38eee1c529bf4ecf3f8424c7ac7ef9717850cc984
```

After the payment confirms, you should that there is one UTXO for this owner address:

```json
scli listunspent 1 99999 '["sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj"]'
[
  {
    "txid": "cf652f54e6a6dde3e60fa4e38eee1c529bf4ecf3f8424c7ac7ef9717850cc984",
    "vout": 1,
    "address": "sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj",
    "account": "",
    "scriptPubKey": "76a91437158152a9768477770ecb7a9e55a5875b9f35b088ac",
    "amount": 10.00000000,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "spendable": true,
    "solvable": true
  }
]
```

Finally, we'll need to configure the deployment tool `solar` to use this particular address as the owner:

```shell
export SBIT_SENDER=sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj
```

We are now ready to deploy our token contract.

## Deploy The Token Contract

The `CappedToken` constructor requires the `_capacity` parameter, to specify the maximum number of tokens we can mint:

```
function CappedToken(uint256 _capacity)
```

It takes quite a few steps to deploy a contract:

1. Use the [solidity compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) to compile the contract into bytecode.
2. [ABI encode](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) the `_capacity` parameter into bytes.
3. Concatenate 1 and 2 together, then make a `createcontract` RPC call to sbitd.
4. Wait for transaction to confirm.
5. Record the address of the contract, and owner of the contract, for later uses.

The [solar](https://github.com/SBit-Project/solar.git) Smart Contract deployment tool (included in the container) handles all of this for you.

To deploy the CappedToken contract, specifying 21 million as the capacity by passing in the constructor parameters as a JSON array (remember to set `SBIT_SENDER`):

```
solar deploy openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/SRC20/CappedToken.sol \
  '[21000000]'
```

Then solar waits for confirmation:

```
ðŸš€  All contracts confirmed
   deployed openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/SRC20/CappedToken.sol =>
      a778c05f1d0f70f1133f4bbf78c1a9a7bf84aed3
```

:::note
You'd get a different contract address
:::

The contract had been deployed to `a778c05f1d0f70f1133f4bbf78c1a9a7bf84aed3`. 

The `solar status` command lists all contracts that had been deployed with solar:

```
solar status

âœ…  openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/SRC20/CappedToken.sol
        txid: 457a5afe15686c0bd596635aeb78d4ff7d2bf6a75df66c7251e89ce4d9c8f6d3
     address: 3db297ee4c225b45219d2a7aa68afea7f4e68832
   confirmed: true
       owner: sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj
```

:::note
Note that the contract's owner should be set to the `SBIT_SENDER` value we have specified earlier. If you did not set `SBIT_SENDER` to anything, a random UTXO from the wallet is selected, and that become the owner.

You can find more information about the deployed contracts in `solar.development.json`.

## The Owner UTXO Address As Sender

The main difference between SBIT and Ethereum is that SBIT is built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, and Ethereum has its own account model, as we've seen in the [SBIT UTXO](../Running-Sbit/utxos-balances) chapter.

In Ethereum, the cost of a transaction is paid by an account. The amount paid is decremented from the account, but the account is still there.

UTXO, however, may be spent only once. So earlier we used an UTXO with the address `sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj` to deploy the contract. That UTXO is now gone, with its entire value spent.

So every time you act as the owner of a contract, you destroy the owner UTXO. And next time you want to act as the owner of the contract, you'd need a new UTXO with the same address. This could be very annoying if you had to do it manually.

Fortunately, when interacting with a contract, SBIT always create a new UTXO with the same address to replace UTXO that was used up.

Listing the UTXO for the owner address `sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj`, we see that, hey, there's still one UTXO, even though we already spent one:

```json
scli listunspent 1 99999 '["sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj"]'
[
  {
    "txid": "457a5afe15686c0bd596635aeb78d4ff7d2bf6a75df66c7251e89ce4d9c8f6d3",
    "vout": 1,
    "address": "sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj",
    "account": "",
    "scriptPubKey": "76a91437158152a9768477770ecb7a9e55a5875b9f35b088ac",
    "amount": 8.78777200,
    "confirmations": 61,
    "spendable": true,
    "solvable": true
  }
]
```

Note, however, that the transaction id `457a...f6d3` is different from the UTXO we had `cf65...c984`. This is a different UTXO, and its amount is 10 minus the fee we paid to deploy the contract.

The amount `8.78777200` is the "change". For a transaction that interacts with a contract, the "change" is paid to the sender. Whereas in a typical payment transaction, the change is paid to a newly generated address controlled by the wallet.

The upshot is that despite the vastly different accounting model between Bitcoin UTXO and Ethereum account, in SBIT they behave in very similar ways.

## Using The ABIPlayer

The `solar.development.json` file stores information about the deployed CappedToken contract. You can load this file into the ABIPlayer to interact with any contracts deployed with solar.

Make sure that the docker container is running, and visit: http://localhost:9899/abiplay/

Load the file, and you should see a list of available contracts and methods:

The gray buttons are readonly methods (call only). The blue buttons support both send and call.

Let's click on the `owner` button, to get the `owner` of this contract:

And we see the owner address returned as a hexadecimal address:

We can convert it back to the base58 UTXO address:

```
scli fromhexaddress dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e94

sdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj
```

## Mint With ABIPlayer

Let's mint some coins for the contract owner! Because we are sending the receiver address into the smart contract, we'll need to format the address in hexadecimal instead of base58.

To mint 1000 tokens:

Click send, and you'll see that the transaction is waiting for authorization:

This request requires your authorization because it costs SBIT. Visit the authorization UI (http://localhost:9899/) to approve it:

Wait for confirmation, and you should see information about the transaction:

You may now call `balanceOf` and `totalSupply` to check if the owner had received the minted tokens, and that the supply had increased accordingly:

## Conclusion

In this chapter we have deployed a basic SRC20 token, and encounter a few tools along the way:

- `solar deploy` to compile & create a contract.
- Use ABIPlayer to interact with deployed contracts: http://localhost:9899/abiplay/
- Authorize requests that cost money: http://localhost:9899/
